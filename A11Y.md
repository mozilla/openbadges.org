# About Problems:
* Need to implement “Jump to” links
Users with limited mobility (ie: only use of keyboard) or screen readers are forced to tab through all mozilla links before content
Solution:  Add “Skip links” where necessary, this applies to before the mozilla bar and anywhere with a menu (where the content is repetitive between pages).

Also considering accesskey= (http://webaim.org/techniques/keyboard/accesskey )

* No Alt text
--The “Sign in”  button has no alt text

Alt text is required for visually impaired users. If text is put in an image (ie: the sign in button) an alt tag must be added with the same text so users know what the button is for.

The most appropriate alt text communicates the purpose of the graphic, not its appearance.
